Computer Memory == RAM - Random Access Memory
    RAM: - physical piece of hardware.
        bits - 1, 0 'on' or 'off'. 8 bits = 1 byte
        4 bit number is 15
        8 bit number is 255

    Binary:
    Decimal         Binary
    25              011001 25-16=9-8=1-1
    63              111111 63-32=31-16=15-8=7-4=3-2=1-1
    9               1001 9-8=1       
    111             1101001 111-64=47-32=15-8=7-4=3-2=1
    243             11110011
    in python bin(243) gives binary value of 11110011
    77              1001101
    153             10011001

    
    Arrays: When there's no space, it will move and create a new array. Use items and store them next to each other, similar address or next to it.

    Strings: (Stored in memory). Convert a letter or string to a number, ASCII table, which is letters and characters assigned to a decimal in memory. char = character, ord(char_a) == 65 the decimal assigned to the letter "A" char(65+10) is "K" (10 letters over from A). Only characters are assigned, not strings. It's all stored in a big box of RAM. We write characters and the computer stores it as numbers or binary.
